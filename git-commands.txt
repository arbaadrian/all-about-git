		### Switching to a remote branch and adding a file:

git branch
	# this will show only the branch you are on (i.e. master), not the remote branch

git checkout --track origin/<remote-branch>
	# this will create a local branch from the remote branch specified (only if branch doesn't exits locally)

echo "text" > file.txt
	# create a new file

git add file.txt
	# stage the file in the git index

git commit -m "adding the file.txt file to the repo"
	# commit the file so that it is ready for pushing into the repo

git push origin
	# push the new commit to the repo

		### Switch to a local branch

git checkout <branch>
	# allows to switch between (or even create) local branches

		### Tagging a branch
	# tagging a branch means tagging the last commit of that branch

git tag -a <tag_name> <sha1-of-commit> -m "tag message"
	# assigns a tag name to the sha1 of a specific commit and also a message for that tag

git tag <tag_name>
	# tags the last commit of the current branch

git tag <tag_name> <branch>
	# tags the last commit of the respective branch

git push --tags origin
	# pushes the tags to the repo

		### Deleting a tag

git push origin :<tag_name>
	# pushes an empty refference to the remote tag name

git tag --delete <tag_name>
	# deletes the local tag

git log
	# to check the current commits - if it has a tag or not after this operation

git tag
	# to check current tags
