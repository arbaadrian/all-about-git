		### Switching to a remote branch and adding a file:

git branch
	# this will show only the branch you are on (i.e. master), not the remote branch

git checkout --track origin/<remote-branch>
	# this will create a local branch from the remote branch specified (only if branch doesn't exits locally)

echo "text" > file.txt
	# create a new file

git add file.txt
	# stage the file in the git index

git commit -m "adding the file.txt file to the repo"
	# commit the file so that it is ready for pushing into the repo

git push origin
	# push the new commit to the repo

		### Switch to a local branch

git checkout <branch>
	# allows to switch between (or even create) local branches

		### Tagging a commit
