Switching to a remote branch and adding a file:

git branch
	# this will show only the branch you are on (i.e. master), not the remote branch
git checkout --track origin/<remote-branch>
	# this will create a local branch from the remote branch specified (only if branch doesn't exits locally)



git checkout <branch>
	# allows to switch between (or even create) local branches
